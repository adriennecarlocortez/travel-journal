# About [Travel Journal](https://adrienne-travel-journal.netlify.app/)

This is my fourth project using React. It's main focus is to use [props](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) to fetch the data from the data file. 

## Quick Start

```
cd travel-journal
npm install
npm run dev
```

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
